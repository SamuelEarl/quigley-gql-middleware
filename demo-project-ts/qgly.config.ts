Queries are set during development and don't change after that. So if the queries are validated during development, then I don't think they need to be validated in production. This will make the queries faster in production because the query validation step can be skipped.

Users can also set the formatting for their queries on a case by case basis by passing `true` or `false` as the third parameter to the quigley function.
